Authors: Csaba Ortutay, Preethy Nair

These scripts are used for calculating  the ratio of the number of 
nonsynonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site (Ka) to the number 
of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (Ks) and some further 
statistics for carbonic anhydrase genes in selected Drosophila genomes.

If you use these scripts for scientific research, please credit the 
authors. If you publish anything with the help of these scripts, please
